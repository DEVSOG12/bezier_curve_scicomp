# BÃ©zier Curve Interactive Visualization Playground

## Overview

This project provides an interactive visualization of cubic BÃ©zier curves using Flutter. The application allows users to modify control points and endpoints, view the resulting curve, and understand how BÃ©zier curves work by displaying their mathematical equations in real-time.

This project is inspired by concepts learned in Math 330, Section 3.5 on BÃ©zier Curves, taught by Prof. Wanda Strychalski at Case Western Reserve University. It demonstrates the mathematical properties and computations behind BÃ©zier curves while offering a UI to explore them dynamically. Cool ðŸš€

## Mathematical Background

### What Are BÃ©zier Curves?

A BÃ©zier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics, animations, and related fields to model smooth curves. In this project, we focus on cubic BÃ©zier curves, which are defined by:

- **Two endpoints**: $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_4, y_4)$.
- **Two control points**: $(x_2, y_2)$ and $(x_3, y_3)$.

The control points influence the direction and curvature of the BÃ©zier curve but are not points on the curve itself.

### Mathematical Equations

The cubic BÃ©zier curve for $0 \leq t \leq 1$ is given by:

$$
x(t) = x_1 + b_x \cdot t + c_x \cdot t^2 + d_x \cdot t^3
$$
$$
y(t) = y_1 + b_y \cdot t + c_y \cdot t^2 + d_y \cdot t^3
$$

where:

$$
b_x = 3(x_2 - x_1), \quad c_x = 3(x_3 - x_2) - b_x, \quad d_x = x_4 - x_1 - b_x - c_x
$$
$$
b_y = 3(y_2 - y_1), \quad c_y = 3(y_3 - y_2) - b_y, \quad d_y = y_4 - y_1 - b_y - c_y
$$

This parameterization ensures a smooth curve between the endpoints, influenced by the control points' relative positions.

### Key Properties

- The slopes at the endpoints are controlled by the vectors connecting the endpoints to their respective control points.
- The curve is sensitive to user input through the scaling of derivatives by a factor of 3, enhancing its responsiveness to control point adjustments.

## Features of the Project

- **Interactive Curve Manipulation**: Users can drag the control points and endpoints to dynamically update the curve.
- **Real-Time Display of Equations**: The BÃ©zier curve equations are displayed and updated as users modify the points.
- **Control Point Editing**: Users can click on control points to input precise coordinates, with validation to ensure proper input.
- **Grid and Axes**: A grid and x/y axes help users visualize the curve in a Cartesian coordinate system.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

1. **`Points.dart`**: A class representing a point with `x` and `y` coordinates.
2. **`BezierComputation.dart`**: Contains the logic to compute BÃ©zier curve coefficients and evaluate points on the curve.
3. **`BezierCurve.dart`**: A class that models a BÃ©zier curve using four points and offers methods to generate points along the curve.
4. **`BezierCanvasPainter.dart`**: A Flutter `CustomPainter` that draws the BÃ©zier curve, grid, axes, and control points on a canvas.
5. **`screen.dart`**: The main UI screen that provides an interface for interacting with the curve.

## Code Explanation

### Computing BÃ©zier Coefficients

The BÃ©zier coefficients $b_x, c_x, d_x, b_y, c_y, d_y$ are computed based on the positions of the control and endpoint coordinates. This calculation ensures that the curve follows a smooth path influenced by the control points.

### Curve Evaluation

Given a parameter $t$ in the range $[0, 1]$, the coordinates $(x(t), y(t))$ of a point on the curve are computed using cubic polynomial interpolation. As users modify the control points, the curve updates in real-time based on the recalculated coefficients.

### User Interaction

- **Dragging Points**: Users can drag endpoints and control points to reshape the curve. The `GestureDetector` component handles user input, updating the curve accordingly.
- **Manual Input**: By clicking on a control point, users can manually input coordinates, with validation to ensure only numerical values are accepted.

## Example Usage

### Initial Configuration

Consider an example BÃ©zier curve defined by the points:

- **Start Point**: $(-100, 0)$
- **Control Point 1**: $(-50, -50)$
- **Control Point 2**: $(50, 50)$
- **End Point**: $(100, 0)$

The curve will be drawn centered on the origin, with the control points influencing the shape. Users can modify these points to observe changes to the curve and corresponding equations.

### Real-World Applications

- BÃ©zier curves are commonly used in font design, graphic animations, and modeling smooth paths.
- This project illustrates the underlying mathematics and provides an intuitive way to understand how control points influence curve shape.
